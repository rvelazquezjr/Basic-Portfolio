    <p>    Hello all! Astronomy has always peaked my interest since I can remember.
        I guess that's why I'm such a geek when it comes to outerspace-based Sci-Fi movies,
        video games, etc. I hope to one day visit an observatory so I can see
        actual cosmic phenomena. Closest I'll ever get in this lifetime anyway seeing these wonders
        with the naked eye.</p>

    <p>    One of the major things on my "bucket list" would be to see, first-hand, the Aurora Borealis
        or "Northern Lights" in Alaska. In fact, I'd try to make it a road trip there! On second thought,
        it should be one or the other. Most likely I'll take an Alaskan cruise and watch if from the ship
        itself. Why not?! It's only money, haha!</p>
