    <p1>Hello all! Astronomy has always peaked my interest since I can remember.
        I guess that's why I'm such a geek when it comes to outerspace-based Sci-Fi movies,
        video games, etc. I hope to one day visit an observatory so I can see
        actual cosmic phenomena. Closest I'll ever get in this lifetime anyway seeing these wonders
        with the naked eye.</p1>
